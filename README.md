# python-gui-clock
A simple digital clock built with Python's Tkinter library. This project demonstrates how to create a basic graphical user interface (GUI) that updates in real-time, displaying the current time using the time module and after() method for continuous refresh. It's a great example for beginners learning about GUI development.
